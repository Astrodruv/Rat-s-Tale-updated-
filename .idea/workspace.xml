This is mister Wagner back with the next episode in our ongoing series of AP US History podcasts. This time, we're dealing with assignment 8.4. And 8.4 is has two main topics. First, society and culture during the nineteen fifties and then the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;So let's talk about society and culture in the nineteen fifties. Let's talk about reviews and reviews. Historians have had changing assessments of the nineteen fifties. From the late fifties on, the count was pretty critical. That was a plastic, plastered, wasted decade of middle class oriented satisfaction.&#10;&#10;It was conservative seen as conservative, conformist, cult cautious, that, you know, The US succeeded in satisfying personal pleasures but neglected public purpose. Now over the past thirty years or so, historians' views in the nineteen fifties have changed. They see it now as a period of prosperity and happy times and of changing perspectives, are are sort of the root of this. We've become a much more conservative country in the last thirty five or so years. And the lengthening perspectives by the eighties and nineties, the fifties seemed okay after the sixties and the turmoil of the sixties and seventies.&#10;&#10;The nineteen fifties weren't a monolith. They were multidimensional and complicated. You had McCarthyism. You had Brown versus Board of Education, the Montgomery bus boycott, Sputnik. I don't think this is placid, do you?&#10;&#10;Extraordinary art, science, and literature, and extraordinarily important social and economic developments occurring almost unnoticed. Below the surface of politics and policy, there were big developments of long lasting impact. And often in history, social and economic and demographic population changes go on regardless of what the government does or doesn't do. So let's talk about the nineteen fifties economy. The nineteen fifties economy was exceptionally prosperous, and The US economy experienced extraordinary growth.&#10;&#10;The gross national product, GNP, the sum total of the value of goods and services produced in the economy was a hundred billion dollars in nineteen forty, two hundred billion dollars in 1945, '3 hundred billion in 1950. And by 1960, it was 500,000,000,000. So this is a quintupling of the GNP in twenty years And, increasing one and a half times just in the decade of the nineteen fifties. That is an explosion of economic productivity. Factors why?&#10;&#10;Why did this happen? The factors leading to economic growth. A lot of private investment. There was a huge jump in private investment. Second, there was a lot of consumer spending.&#10;&#10;Still pent up demand from the war and people making better money from post war jobs. Government spending on both defense and social welfare programs, military and domestic spending. And the federal government's percent federal government spending as a percentage of the gross national product, by the nineteen sixties was at 17%. You look at the nineteen twenties, it was 1%. So the amount relative amount that the government's spending is influencing the GNP really significantly fueled growth as well.&#10;&#10;Also, the baby boom, and we're gonna talk about, the baby boom. The baby boom and and all that went with it also fueled spending. Fifth, technology and automation and the first computers. Output per worker went up 50%, but prices stayed down. It was a very low period of inflation.&#10;&#10;So real income and the standard of living went up. Farm technology, increased agricultural production, which meant lower prices. And so the percentage of the their income that a family had to spend on food, went down while their overall income went up, which meant they had a lot more income for other things other than food, to spend on other things other than food. Also, factor in the economy was what we call giantism, the domination of the economy by massive huge corporations. And by 1958, zero point '1 percent of all corporations accounted for 50% of corporate income.&#10;&#10;And consolidation was going on in farming too with smaller family farms being bought out by agricultural agricultural corporations and the prevalence of agribusiness. So affluence. Real wages, that's wages adjusted for inflation, in the nineteen fifties increased 20%. And by the late nineteen fifties, '2 thirds of the population was in middle class ranking. And by the mid fifties, there are more white collar workers than blue collar workers, more administrative and service oriented people than there were factory workers.&#10;&#10;The fifties also saw the explosion of a consumer culture. In in the nineteen fifties, the US made up 5% of the world's population, but have accounted for one third of the world's consumption of goods and services. Also, with more leisure time, people working fewer hours and increased life expectancy, life expectancy on average, increased from around 60 to around 70 in the nineteen fifties. And so people had more time on their hands to buy stuff. And you look at advertising.&#10;&#10;Advertising in the nineteen fifties increased the amount of money spent on advertising increased 400%. People were also buying on credit. Consumer credit went from 8,000,000,000 in 1950 to 50,000,000,000 in 1960. Another area of phenomenal growth and domination, television becomes a huge thing in the nineteen fifties. Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In 1946, there were 17,000 televisions in The United States. Okay? Just eleven years later in 1957, there were 40,000,000 televisions. Okay? The number of cars exploded as well.&#10;&#10;Nineteen forty five, there were 26,000,000 registered automobiles. In 1960, '60 '2 million registered automobiles. There's also a huge amount of home building in the nineteen fifties. Okay? Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In '19 if we went around in 1960 and looked at all the existing homes in The United States in 1960, we would find that between a quarter and a third of them had been built in the nineteen fifties, which is crazy. And by the nineteen fifties, '50 percent of families owned their own homes. So all of this growth is just absolutely off the charts. And it's not that you need to know the specific statistics, but just the pattern. Okay?&#10;&#10;The patterns that that are going on. However, amidst all this prosperity, there still were what I like to call pervasive pockets of poverty. But this poverty seemed more and more invisible. Why? Because it was increasingly, rare and out of the main sort of sort of way that people traveled, because of interstate highways, partially.&#10;&#10;Power pervasive pockets of poverty were mostly in inner city areas and isolated rural areas, and and existed among the elderly with fixed incomes, minorities, non white people, unskilled and uneducated workers, Southerners, both white and black, and households headed by women. So that's where I wanted to go with an initial kinda discussion of the nineteen fifties economy. Huge prosperity, but in the midst of that, pervasive pockets of poverty. Now very, very important in the nineteen fifties are demographic patterns, shifts and patterns in the population. The biggest one is known as the baby boom, and the baby boom generation is considered anybody who was born between the years 1946 and 1964.&#10;&#10;In those years, the birth rate went up thirty three percent. Okay? Now that was temporary, and it went back down starting in the mid sixties. But and it was a reversal of a long term trend. But tons of babies being born in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The US population in the fifties went from a 50,000,000 to a 80,000,000. And a lot of that fueled by natural increase, meaning by not by immigration, but by people having lots of babies. In 1935, there were 33,000,000 kids 14. It was 25% of the population. In 1960, there were 56,000,000 kids 14.&#10;&#10;One third of a much larger population. The effects of this, the cult of domesticity came back. Women seen as the, you know, their role being as creating the ideal household environment for husband and kids because it had to because there were so many kids. It also fueled prosperity because with all these kids, you're gonna have the building of schools and things like that. But the prosperity fueled the baby boom too.&#10;&#10;People were having more kids because they were doing better economically. It also contributed to the unrest of the nineteen sixties because you had this huge age age cohort going into colleges, etcetera, and also the economic squeeze of the seventies and eighties because when that age cohort you know, this large age cohort of people reaching a a point where they're going out and getting jobs and there just wasn't weren't enough jobs for them. So demographic trend number one, the baby boom. Second demographic trend, a move to the Sun Belt States. Population was flowing to states where the weather tended to be nicer and warmer for longer the year.&#10;&#10;People moving from the industrial Northeast industrial quadrant to the Pacific Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the South Atlantic. And this this had already been going on, but it accelerated in the nineteen fifties. The population of the West Coast in the forties and fifties increased a 10%. Think about that. The population of the West Coast more than doubled.&#10;&#10;Why? Well, the warmer climate, but those states tended to also, in those days, have lower taxes and greater economic opportunity. A lot of defense industries had been set up in the Sun Belt States. So what were the effects of the move to the Sunbelt? Well, changes in lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Second, location of businesses. Third, there was a political sort of effect because the Sunbelt States tended to be, in those days, more conservative. And so if the population goes up, they get more representatives in the house, and they get more electoral votes in presidential elections. And so it shifts shifts in the political power to the Sunbelt State areas. And you can see partly an example of this flow of population is the movement of Major League Baseball teams.&#10;&#10;It's in this era that the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn out to Los Angeles. The Giants moved from New York to San Francisco. The Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee and then to Atlanta. And the A's move from Philadelphia to Kansas City and then eventually to Oakland. So baseball moves to the Sun Belt as the population moves to the Sun Belt.&#10;&#10;Demographic change and trend number three, the movement to suburbs. Causes, there was a housing shortage, a desperate housing shortage, and a construction boom. Second, mass produced low cost family houses, prefab houses. They were these housing developments were known as Levittowns. The first one being on Long Island.&#10;&#10;These just kinda like cookie cutter houses on perfectly gridded, you know, street setups, etcetera, that that could be constructed very quickly in large numbers known as Levittowns. So if you see the term Levittown, it refers to the increased suburbanization of The United States in the nineteen fifties. Low mortgage rates, government insured, and tax deductible, so buying a house was more affordable as well. And by the nineteen sixties, the number of suburbanites equaled the number of urbanites. Okay.&#10;&#10;So what what were the effects of this? Well, people moving lots of people moving from the rural United States to both cities and suburbs. Second, the middle class moving out of the cities to the suburbs because they wanted to escape all the problems associated with city life. Third, more African Americans moving into inner cities from the Midwest and the South. 4, the relocation of businesses and industry to the suburbs because that's where people were moving.&#10;&#10;So you have the first shopping malls, and these shopping malls replace downtown urban shopping areas. Suburbanization is a disaster for American cities. By the nineteen sixties, cities are increasingly poor and racially segregated and divided. And the political power of cities, because they're losing population, decreases. And you also have, you know, what we would call suburban sprawl, etcetera, going on as well.&#10;&#10;Okay. Now let's take a look at nineteen fifties popular culture. It's a consumer culture and a culture of conformity. First off, television. Television suddenly became the center of family life.&#10;&#10;It was dominated by the three major networks. You didn't have cable and then you had three channels basically, ABC, CBS, NBC. It was very bland. Mostly what was on there was pretty much identical sitcoms, westerns, quiz shows, and sports. And the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Newton Minow, called it a vast cultural wasteland.&#10;&#10;And there already was a concern about what the impact of excessive TV viewing would have on the kids. But the culture portrayed on TV helped homogenize US culture. We have, you know, had shows like Ozzie and Harriet, I Love Lucy, Father Knows Best. You know, some of those shows you can still watch on some of the classic channels. They still show them.&#10;&#10;Advertising, promoted common material wants and the means to satisfy them. We have the first, again, the first malls and the first credit cards. And you see a change from so called mom and pop stores to franchises. For example, McDonald's, first comes on the scene in the nineteen fifties. Another trend in the nineteen fifties was paperback books.&#10;&#10;US was reading more than ever. Listen to this. By by 1960 in The United States, a million paperback books were sold a day. A million a day. Pop music also revolutionized by mass marketing of, vinyl LPs and 40 fives that were really sync cheap.&#10;&#10;And the the emergent trend in music in the nineteen fifties, of course, was rock and roll. The introduce introduction of rock and roll, which derived from African American music, African American rhythm and blues, blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz. And also threw in a little bit of, influence of white country music as well. And, of course, the biggest star in the nineteen fifties was Elvis. Thank you very much.&#10;&#10;Elvis Presley. Alright. Corporate America was dominated by these huge conglomerates with diversified holdings, and that became the trend. And it caused conformity. Working for a big company, it was seen that perhaps it caused people to lose their individuality.&#10;&#10;You would conform to the corporate team, you know, conservative dress. And the loss of individuality was domin documented in the book by a sociologist William White, called The Organization Man, which was published in 1956. You also had huge labor unions, the AFL and the CIO merged in 1955 to become the AFL CIO. And unions also became more conservative as blue collar workers work their way up toward middle class incomes. And you also had the, you know, the peer pressure of conforming, in the middle class suburbs.&#10;&#10;In terms of religion, organized religion boomed after World War two, maybe fueled by fears from the cold war. New religious tolerance and a lack of interest in religious doctrine became the norm. You also had radio and TV, the first televangelists on TV. A guy by the name of Billy Graham, became the most famous televangelist in in America. And religious member membership in a church became a source of identity and and and also socialization.&#10;&#10;Okay. In terms of women, traditional roles were reaffirmed. The baby boom necessitated, homemaking as a full time job for for millions of women. And you had doctor Benjamin Spock and his book, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946, reinforces the mother's role as caregiver. But there's growing dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;More women are also at the same time, it's kinda weird. There's two trends going on. More women are working in the nineteen fifties. Women are 30% of the workforce by 1960. College educated, middle class, and married women are working more and starting their own careers because they want to, not necessarily just to supplement the family's income.&#10;&#10;And maybe this revival of the cult of domesticity was actually a reaction against social changes that were already taking place. There were plenty of social critics of the conformity of the nineteen fifties. There were social scientists such as the sociologist David Reisman, who wrote a book called The Lonely Crowd in 1958. He criticized the replacement of the interdirected individual with, people focused on outer directed conformity. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith, wrote a book called The Affluent Society also in 1958, which talked about the failure of the wealthy United States to address the need for increased spending on social programs for the common good.&#10;&#10;And these all are gonna influence both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the nineteen sixties where we're gonna see another, you know, with Lyndon Johnson's great society, another spurt of social reform impetus. And finally, also in novels, big theme in novels in the nineteen fifties is the individual struggle against conformity. One of the the most typical novels here is JD Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. And many of you may have read Catcher in the Rye. It's it's a comment on the phoniness of of nineteen fifties culture by a rebellious teenager.&#10;&#10;Okay? You also had Joseph Heller's Catch 22, satire of the stupidity of the military and of war. And then a guy by the name of Ralph Ellison, an African American who wrote a book called The Invisible Man, which talked about the African American condition in the nineteen fifties. Avant garde saw the emergence of the Beat Generation, the Beatniks, rebellious writers and intellectuals in the fifties, led by a guy named Jack Kerouac in his book On the Road from 1957 and the poet Allen Ginsberg in his poem Howl from 1956. They advocated spontaneity, use of drugs, and rebellion against societal standards.&#10;&#10;And they became models for the youth rebellion of the nineteen sixties, which we will be dealing with in later assignments. Okay. That kind of wraps up the first main topic of 8.4, and that's nineteen fifties society and culture. Okay. Now we get into the second part of the podcast, and this is on the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;Let's start with the the goals, nature, and roots of the civil rights movement. What were the major goals? To restore the original and full meanings of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. In other words, if you do that, you end segregation, you end Jim Crow, and you guarantee voting rights. It was fundamentally inclusionary.&#10;&#10;African Americans wanting to be included in within the full exercise of citizenship and voting rights. It was also integrationist, interracial in ideology and makeup. So there was there was both races taking part here rooted largely in the African American experience, but there was a good deal of white support both asked for and received. Initially, it's focused on the South because the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were basically dead in the water. They're not being enforced.&#10;&#10;African Americans had been denied the right to vote in the late eighteen hundreds. You had Jim Crow laws and desegregation and discrimination and prejudice in all aspects of life. African Americans in the South were sanctioned were victims of sanctioned violence by law and had nowhere to turn, in the government or the courts. There's no way that a southern white jury would convict a white person for, murdering an African American. Now the civil rights movement takes on two wings.&#10;&#10;First off, a movement at law. One wing, the movement at law, trying to deal with the three branches of government. This was centered around from 1910 on, the NAACP, which filed lawsuits to get the courts to declare violations of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment by the Southern states. Also included, effort to get new laws passed by congress to stop the abuses. And then efforts to get whatever whoever happened to be president to actually enforce and espouse these new laws.&#10;&#10;So the movement at law, court cases get new laws passed, get laws enforced, NAACP. The other wing was a grassroots participatory movement characterized by the use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay? Use use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay.&#10;&#10;Some of the background and roots of the civil rights movement. In 1910, the founding of the NAACP by W. E. B. Du Bois used the courts and aim at an inclusionary society, restoring rights, etcetera.&#10;&#10;It was viewed as radical in the early nineteen hundreds, but by 1960 or so, seen as fairly moderate. Second, the movements for black separatism, black power, Booker t coming from Booker t Washington and his economic self help approach. In the nineteen twenties, Marcus Garvey and his, black nationalism ideas. The great migration has is a factor because it makes race a national issue. Before the Great Migration, ninety percent of African Americans lived in the South.&#10;&#10;So it was just kind of an isolated seen as an isolated Southern issue, and that changes. You you also had the FDR administrations in the nineteen thirties, looking after African American issues, etcetera, to an extent with his his black cabinet, etcetera. And then, you know, there were some pickets and boycotts in the nineteen thirties. But the re one of the real catalysts, and we've talked about this before, was World War two. World War two increased aspirations, for African Americans and when, because it provided better education and economic opportunities.&#10;&#10;You had a Philip Randolph's march, threatened march on Washington, which forced, FDR, remember, to issue executive order eighty eight zero two, which banned hiring, discrimination in hiring in defense industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission. You had the double v campaign during World War two. Okay? And the growth in membership of the NAACP during the war from 50,000 to 450,000. And then post World War two, you had Truman who was the first president to openly advocate civil rights.&#10;&#10;Remember in 1948, he desegregated the military. You had the post war growth of African American organizations, both the NAACP and a new one called CORE, Congress on Racial Equality, which focused on, direct action nonviolent protest. And you had the NAACP chipping away at, desec segregation and Jim Crow laws, through the federal courts. But it's in the post World War two years that the civil rights movement turns into a mass movement, and there's a couple reasons for that. First was African American urbanization.&#10;&#10;African Americans moving because of the great migration, moving more and more to cities, find commonalities among themselves, and it ends their rural isolation. They saw together that they had the power to challenge discrimination. And, therefore, the movement in the nineteen fifties is gonna be strongest in southern cities. Secondly, religious faith plays a big role. Faith that everyone is equal before god gave African Americans greater determination to work for equality.&#10;&#10;And the centers of the movement are going to be the African American churches and historically African American colleges in southern cities. They provided places to meet, plan, and pray, and also provided leadership for the movement, for example, like the reverend doctor doctor Martin Luther King Junior. Okay? The focus on constitutional rights was also significant because African Americans felt confident that what they were asking for was already sanctioned by the constitution, through the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and therefore, they were not asking for anything extremely radical. Fourth, media coverage of what was going on was absolutely crucial.&#10;&#10;Television coverage showed what was happening and produced shock and outrage even among northern whites. And it may also made The US look bad in Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. And finally, African independence movements in the nineteen fifties and sixties inspired American African Americans and challenged them to work harder. Okay. Now we get into the major events that are significant for the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The first being the landmark Supreme Court case, Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, oftentimes shortened as into Brown versus Board. This was in 1954. In 1954, the chief justice, Earl Warren, made a ruling, which upheld and sanctioned the argument made by the NAACP lawyer in the case, a guy by the name of Thurgood Marshall, who, by the way, is a was a Baltimore native. Thurgood Marshall, is a very famous African American. He first becomes nationally well known for successfully arguing the Brown versus Board case in 1954.&#10;&#10;And then in 1967, president Lyndon Johnson appoints him the first African American to ever sit on the Supreme Court. The ID what the Brown versus Board of Education decision did was it overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine. Okay? So you wanna know that. That comes up a lot.&#10;&#10;It overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine by saying separate facilities are inherently unequal. That was Marshall's argument. Chief justice Earl Warren and the court agreed. Separate facilities were ruled inherently unequal and violations of the fourteenth amendment. Therefore, school segregation was unconstitutional and illegal.&#10;&#10;Now there was a follow-up decision called Brown two in nineteen fifty four five, which was the implementing decision. And the court said there, and this was kind of ambivalent, that the South must desegregate its public schools, quote, with all deliberate speed and good faith. This is gonna lead to Southern intransigence and Southern states dragging their feet on the issue. But the fundamental breakthrough decision is made. Plessy is overturned.&#10;&#10;Separate facilities are inherently unequal. Okay? The impact is a reaction by Southerners. The Southern members of Congress, put together a a document called the Southern Manifesto saying that the Brown decision was an abuse of judicial power and a violation of states' rights. But the decision laid the foundations for the restoration of rights and the fourteenth amendment, and it also raised expectations and injected a lot of energy into the civil rights movement.&#10;&#10;But at first, the Southern states do very little to desegregate, and so there's gonna have to be additional things that happen down the road. Second event in the summer of nineteen fifty five was the lynching of Emmett Till. Emmett Till was a 14 year old African American from Chicago who was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he called out to a white woman who was exiting a store. Her she went home, told her husband, her husband and some of his buddies found out where Emmett Till was staying. He was taken, and he was lynched.&#10;&#10;And it received extensive media coverage with photo spreads, pretty graphic photo spreads in both Life and Jack Jet magazines, and it horrified the nation. Everyone knew who did it, but the clearly guilty white defendants were acquitted by a white Mississippi jury. The impact was outrage and horror, the view among Northerners that the southern judicial system was a joke, and it further injected energy into the civil rights movement for African Americans to stand up against whites. The third major event was the Montgomery bus boycott of nineteen fifty six. 12/01/1955, a woman named Rosa Parks defied the law requiring in Montgomery, Alabama defied the the law requiring African Americans to give up their seats to white passengers and sit in the back of the bus.&#10;&#10;She's arrested and jailed. Rosa Parks' arrest mobilized the black community in Montgomery, Alabama, and African American women in Montgomery organized a boycott of city buses to put economic pressure on the bus company since most of the bus company's customers were African American. And very significantly, a new leader emerges, in this movement, and that is doctor Reverend Martin Luther King Junior, born in Atlanta, PhD in theology from Boston University. And he had just come to he had not been in Montgomery very long. He'd become a pastor in Montgomery in 1954.&#10;&#10;And he certainly didn't become go there expecting to become the iconic leader of the civil rights movement, but that's what happened. He's only 27 years old, and African American leaders in Montgomery recognized his eloquence and his political skill. He was greatly influenced by Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi and their strategies and tactics of nonviolent direct action protest. The boycott took huge sacrifices on the part of African Americans. They had to walk, carpool, etcetera.&#10;&#10;King's House was bombed one one month into the boycott. White leaders in Montgomery formed a White Citizens Council, made up of 10,000 Montgomery whites, and it spurred the formation of white white citizens councils all over the South in the fifties, to oppose integration. They were known as the, Uptown KKK. They were more, you know, slightly more sophisticated and more urban than the KKK. Rosa Parks' test case went to the Supreme Court in 1956, and the court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.&#10;&#10;It's a great victory for the civil rights movement. And it's an ideal link of the bus boycott and Martin Luther King Junior. Alright? And the nonviolent direct action protest becomes the number one tactic of the civil rights movement. And King plays a role no one else can play and plays it with consummate skill.&#10;&#10;The final event that I wanna talk about is, we'll get into this. The the Brown the Brown and Montgomery bus boycott bound decision Montgomery bus boycott powerfully accelerate the civil rights movement. And the movement at law, a victory in the court case in Brown, energized the grassroots side of the movement, which led to, the Montgomery Bus Boycott. So you have this sort of circling, cycling influence between the movement at law and the grassroots movement. Okay.&#10;&#10;Let's go to 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The governor of Arkansas, a guy by the name of Orville Faubus, opposed the desegregation of schools in the capital city of Little Rock. He ordered the National Guard to prevent nine black students from entering all white Central High School in Little Rock. And when these students attempted to enter, a white mob screamed at them. There was a move to lynch them, but that was defused thankfully.&#10;&#10;President Eisenhower was slow to act. He didn't believe in using the federal government to stop segregation. But with Faubus' challenge and defiance of a Supreme Court decision, Eisenhower had no choice. As president, he had to enforce federal law. And he reluctantly ordered federal troops to Little Rock to maintain order while the law was carried out.&#10;&#10;And Eisenhower said, mob rule cannot override the decisions of our courts. The troops escorted the African American kids to class every day, and the situation stayed tense. In fact, Faubus, the following school year, shut down the Little Rock schools entirely, in an effort to stop desegregation. But in 1958, the Supreme Court ruled that evasive schemes to avoid integration were illegal. And in 1959, the Little Rock Schools were peacefully reopened and integrated.&#10;&#10;Now so despite all this, finally, there were some disappointments. The desegregation of schools went about, painfully slowly, due to white intransigence. The civil there was a Civil Rights Act passed in 1957 by congress. It set up a US Commission on Civil Rights to investigate violations, but it had no enforcement powers. Alright?&#10;&#10;A voting rights act in passed in 1960 was an absolute joke, and it was clear that more grassroots action had to happen. And so that just plays into what's gonna go in, to the civil rights movement in the nineteen sixties, which is one of our topics in assignment 8.6. So there you have it, folks. Nineteen fifties society and culture and the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties. Take care.">

    <task id="LOCAL-00005" summary="Add files via upload&#10;&#10;&#10;Well, hello again. This is mister Wagner back with the next episode in our ongoing series of AP US History podcasts. This time, we're dealing with assignment 8.4. And 8.4 is has two main topics. First, society and culture during the nineteen fifties and then the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;So let's talk about society and culture in the nineteen fifties. Let's talk about reviews and reviews. Historians have had changing assessments of the nineteen fifties. From the late fifties on, the count was pretty critical. That was a plastic, plastered, wasted decade of middle class oriented satisfaction.&#10;&#10;It was conservative seen as conservative, conformist, cult cautious, that, you know, The US succeeded in satisfying personal pleasures but neglected public purpose. Now over the past thirty years or so, historians' views in the nineteen fifties have changed. They see it now as a period of prosperity and happy times and of changing perspectives, are are sort of the root of this. We've become a much more conservative country in the last thirty five or so years. And the lengthening perspectives by the eighties and nineties, the fifties seemed okay after the sixties and the turmoil of the sixties and seventies.&#10;&#10;The nineteen fifties weren't a monolith. They were multidimensional and complicated. You had McCarthyism. You had Brown versus Board of Education, the Montgomery bus boycott, Sputnik. I don't think this is placid, do you?&#10;&#10;Extraordinary art, science, and literature, and extraordinarily important social and economic developments occurring almost unnoticed. Below the surface of politics and policy, there were big developments of long lasting impact. And often in history, social and economic and demographic population changes go on regardless of what the government does or doesn't do. So let's talk about the nineteen fifties economy. The nineteen fifties economy was exceptionally prosperous, and The US economy experienced extraordinary growth.&#10;&#10;The gross national product, GNP, the sum total of the value of goods and services produced in the economy was a hundred billion dollars in nineteen forty, two hundred billion dollars in 1945, '3 hundred billion in 1950. And by 1960, it was 500,000,000,000. So this is a quintupling of the GNP in twenty years And, increasing one and a half times just in the decade of the nineteen fifties. That is an explosion of economic productivity. Factors why?&#10;&#10;Why did this happen? The factors leading to economic growth. A lot of private investment. There was a huge jump in private investment. Second, there was a lot of consumer spending.&#10;&#10;Still pent up demand from the war and people making better money from post war jobs. Government spending on both defense and social welfare programs, military and domestic spending. And the federal government's percent federal government spending as a percentage of the gross national product, by the nineteen sixties was at 17%. You look at the nineteen twenties, it was 1%. So the amount relative amount that the government's spending is influencing the GNP really significantly fueled growth as well.&#10;&#10;Also, the baby boom, and we're gonna talk about, the baby boom. The baby boom and and all that went with it also fueled spending. Fifth, technology and automation and the first computers. Output per worker went up 50%, but prices stayed down. It was a very low period of inflation.&#10;&#10;So real income and the standard of living went up. Farm technology, increased agricultural production, which meant lower prices. And so the percentage of the their income that a family had to spend on food, went down while their overall income went up, which meant they had a lot more income for other things other than food, to spend on other things other than food. Also, factor in the economy was what we call giantism, the domination of the economy by massive huge corporations. And by 1958, zero point '1 percent of all corporations accounted for 50% of corporate income.&#10;&#10;And consolidation was going on in farming too with smaller family farms being bought out by agricultural agricultural corporations and the prevalence of agribusiness. So affluence. Real wages, that's wages adjusted for inflation, in the nineteen fifties increased 20%. And by the late nineteen fifties, '2 thirds of the population was in middle class ranking. And by the mid fifties, there are more white collar workers than blue collar workers, more administrative and service oriented people than there were factory workers.&#10;&#10;The fifties also saw the explosion of a consumer culture. In in the nineteen fifties, the US made up 5% of the world's population, but have accounted for one third of the world's consumption of goods and services. Also, with more leisure time, people working fewer hours and increased life expectancy, life expectancy on average, increased from around 60 to around 70 in the nineteen fifties. And so people had more time on their hands to buy stuff. And you look at advertising.&#10;&#10;Advertising in the nineteen fifties increased the amount of money spent on advertising increased 400%. People were also buying on credit. Consumer credit went from 8,000,000,000 in 1950 to 50,000,000,000 in 1960. Another area of phenomenal growth and domination, television becomes a huge thing in the nineteen fifties. Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In 1946, there were 17,000 televisions in The United States. Okay? Just eleven years later in 1957, there were 40,000,000 televisions. Okay? The number of cars exploded as well.&#10;&#10;Nineteen forty five, there were 26,000,000 registered automobiles. In 1960, '60 '2 million registered automobiles. There's also a huge amount of home building in the nineteen fifties. Okay? Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In '19 if we went around in 1960 and looked at all the existing homes in The United States in 1960, we would find that between a quarter and a third of them had been built in the nineteen fifties, which is crazy. And by the nineteen fifties, '50 percent of families owned their own homes. So all of this growth is just absolutely off the charts. And it's not that you need to know the specific statistics, but just the pattern. Okay?&#10;&#10;The patterns that that are going on. However, amidst all this prosperity, there still were what I like to call pervasive pockets of poverty. But this poverty seemed more and more invisible. Why? Because it was increasingly, rare and out of the main sort of sort of way that people traveled, because of interstate highways, partially.&#10;&#10;Power pervasive pockets of poverty were mostly in inner city areas and isolated rural areas, and and existed among the elderly with fixed incomes, minorities, non white people, unskilled and uneducated workers, Southerners, both white and black, and households headed by women. So that's where I wanted to go with an initial kinda discussion of the nineteen fifties economy. Huge prosperity, but in the midst of that, pervasive pockets of poverty. Now very, very important in the nineteen fifties are demographic patterns, shifts and patterns in the population. The biggest one is known as the baby boom, and the baby boom generation is considered anybody who was born between the years 1946 and 1964.&#10;&#10;In those years, the birth rate went up thirty three percent. Okay? Now that was temporary, and it went back down starting in the mid sixties. But and it was a reversal of a long term trend. But tons of babies being born in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The US population in the fifties went from a 50,000,000 to a 80,000,000. And a lot of that fueled by natural increase, meaning by not by immigration, but by people having lots of babies. In 1935, there were 33,000,000 kids 14. It was 25% of the population. In 1960, there were 56,000,000 kids 14.&#10;&#10;One third of a much larger population. The effects of this, the cult of domesticity came back. Women seen as the, you know, their role being as creating the ideal household environment for husband and kids because it had to because there were so many kids. It also fueled prosperity because with all these kids, you're gonna have the building of schools and things like that. But the prosperity fueled the baby boom too.&#10;&#10;People were having more kids because they were doing better economically. It also contributed to the unrest of the nineteen sixties because you had this huge age age cohort going into colleges, etcetera, and also the economic squeeze of the seventies and eighties because when that age cohort you know, this large age cohort of people reaching a a point where they're going out and getting jobs and there just wasn't weren't enough jobs for them. So demographic trend number one, the baby boom. Second demographic trend, a move to the Sun Belt States. Population was flowing to states where the weather tended to be nicer and warmer for longer the year.&#10;&#10;People moving from the industrial Northeast industrial quadrant to the Pacific Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the South Atlantic. And this this had already been going on, but it accelerated in the nineteen fifties. The population of the West Coast in the forties and fifties increased a 10%. Think about that. The population of the West Coast more than doubled.&#10;&#10;Why? Well, the warmer climate, but those states tended to also, in those days, have lower taxes and greater economic opportunity. A lot of defense industries had been set up in the Sun Belt States. So what were the effects of the move to the Sunbelt? Well, changes in lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Second, location of businesses. Third, there was a political sort of effect because the Sunbelt States tended to be, in those days, more conservative. And so if the population goes up, they get more representatives in the house, and they get more electoral votes in presidential elections. And so it shifts shifts in the political power to the Sunbelt State areas. And you can see partly an example of this flow of population is the movement of Major League Baseball teams.&#10;&#10;It's in this era that the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn out to Los Angeles. The Giants moved from New York to San Francisco. The Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee and then to Atlanta. And the A's move from Philadelphia to Kansas City and then eventually to Oakland. So baseball moves to the Sun Belt as the population moves to the Sun Belt.&#10;&#10;Demographic change and trend number three, the movement to suburbs. Causes, there was a housing shortage, a desperate housing shortage, and a construction boom. Second, mass produced low cost family houses, prefab houses. They were these housing developments were known as Levittowns. The first one being on Long Island.&#10;&#10;These just kinda like cookie cutter houses on perfectly gridded, you know, street setups, etcetera, that that could be constructed very quickly in large numbers known as Levittowns. So if you see the term Levittown, it refers to the increased suburbanization of The United States in the nineteen fifties. Low mortgage rates, government insured, and tax deductible, so buying a house was more affordable as well. And by the nineteen sixties, the number of suburbanites equaled the number of urbanites. Okay.&#10;&#10;So what what were the effects of this? Well, people moving lots of people moving from the rural United States to both cities and suburbs. Second, the middle class moving out of the cities to the suburbs because they wanted to escape all the problems associated with city life. Third, more African Americans moving into inner cities from the Midwest and the South. 4, the relocation of businesses and industry to the suburbs because that's where people were moving.&#10;&#10;So you have the first shopping malls, and these shopping malls replace downtown urban shopping areas. Suburbanization is a disaster for American cities. By the nineteen sixties, cities are increasingly poor and racially segregated and divided. And the political power of cities, because they're losing population, decreases. And you also have, you know, what we would call suburban sprawl, etcetera, going on as well.&#10;&#10;Okay. Now let's take a look at nineteen fifties popular culture. It's a consumer culture and a culture of conformity. First off, television. Television suddenly became the center of family life.&#10;&#10;It was dominated by the three major networks. You didn't have cable and then you had three channels basically, ABC, CBS, NBC. It was very bland. Mostly what was on there was pretty much identical sitcoms, westerns, quiz shows, and sports. And the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Newton Minow, called it a vast cultural wasteland.&#10;&#10;And there already was a concern about what the impact of excessive TV viewing would have on the kids. But the culture portrayed on TV helped homogenize US culture. We have, you know, had shows like Ozzie and Harriet, I Love Lucy, Father Knows Best. You know, some of those shows you can still watch on some of the classic channels. They still show them.&#10;&#10;Advertising, promoted common material wants and the means to satisfy them. We have the first, again, the first malls and the first credit cards. And you see a change from so called mom and pop stores to franchises. For example, McDonald's, first comes on the scene in the nineteen fifties. Another trend in the nineteen fifties was paperback books.&#10;&#10;US was reading more than ever. Listen to this. By by 1960 in The United States, a million paperback books were sold a day. A million a day. Pop music also revolutionized by mass marketing of, vinyl LPs and 40 fives that were really sync cheap.&#10;&#10;And the the emergent trend in music in the nineteen fifties, of course, was rock and roll. The introduce introduction of rock and roll, which derived from African American music, African American rhythm and blues, blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz. And also threw in a little bit of, influence of white country music as well. And, of course, the biggest star in the nineteen fifties was Elvis. Thank you very much.&#10;&#10;Elvis Presley. Alright. Corporate America was dominated by these huge conglomerates with diversified holdings, and that became the trend. And it caused conformity. Working for a big company, it was seen that perhaps it caused people to lose their individuality.&#10;&#10;You would conform to the corporate team, you know, conservative dress. And the loss of individuality was domin documented in the book by a sociologist William White, called The Organization Man, which was published in 1956. You also had huge labor unions, the AFL and the CIO merged in 1955 to become the AFL CIO. And unions also became more conservative as blue collar workers work their way up toward middle class incomes. And you also had the, you know, the peer pressure of conforming, in the middle class suburbs.&#10;&#10;In terms of religion, organized religion boomed after World War two, maybe fueled by fears from the cold war. New religious tolerance and a lack of interest in religious doctrine became the norm. You also had radio and TV, the first televangelists on TV. A guy by the name of Billy Graham, became the most famous televangelist in in America. And religious member membership in a church became a source of identity and and and also socialization.&#10;&#10;Okay. In terms of women, traditional roles were reaffirmed. The baby boom necessitated, homemaking as a full time job for for millions of women. And you had doctor Benjamin Spock and his book, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946, reinforces the mother's role as caregiver. But there's growing dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;More women are also at the same time, it's kinda weird. There's two trends going on. More women are working in the nineteen fifties. Women are 30% of the workforce by 1960. College educated, middle class, and married women are working more and starting their own careers because they want to, not necessarily just to supplement the family's income.&#10;&#10;And maybe this revival of the cult of domesticity was actually a reaction against social changes that were already taking place. There were plenty of social critics of the conformity of the nineteen fifties. There were social scientists such as the sociologist David Reisman, who wrote a book called The Lonely Crowd in 1958. He criticized the replacement of the interdirected individual with, people focused on outer directed conformity. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith, wrote a book called The Affluent Society also in 1958, which talked about the failure of the wealthy United States to address the need for increased spending on social programs for the common good.&#10;&#10;And these all are gonna influence both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the nineteen sixties where we're gonna see another, you know, with Lyndon Johnson's great society, another spurt of social reform impetus. And finally, also in novels, big theme in novels in the nineteen fifties is the individual struggle against conformity. One of the the most typical novels here is JD Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. And many of you may have read Catcher in the Rye. It's it's a comment on the phoniness of of nineteen fifties culture by a rebellious teenager.&#10;&#10;Okay? You also had Joseph Heller's Catch 22, satire of the stupidity of the military and of war. And then a guy by the name of Ralph Ellison, an African American who wrote a book called The Invisible Man, which talked about the African American condition in the nineteen fifties. Avant garde saw the emergence of the Beat Generation, the Beatniks, rebellious writers and intellectuals in the fifties, led by a guy named Jack Kerouac in his book On the Road from 1957 and the poet Allen Ginsberg in his poem Howl from 1956. They advocated spontaneity, use of drugs, and rebellion against societal standards.&#10;&#10;And they became models for the youth rebellion of the nineteen sixties, which we will be dealing with in later assignments. Okay. That kind of wraps up the first main topic of 8.4, and that's nineteen fifties society and culture. Okay. Now we get into the second part of the podcast, and this is on the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;Let's start with the the goals, nature, and roots of the civil rights movement. What were the major goals? To restore the original and full meanings of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. In other words, if you do that, you end segregation, you end Jim Crow, and you guarantee voting rights. It was fundamentally inclusionary.&#10;&#10;African Americans wanting to be included in within the full exercise of citizenship and voting rights. It was also integrationist, interracial in ideology and makeup. So there was there was both races taking part here rooted largely in the African American experience, but there was a good deal of white support both asked for and received. Initially, it's focused on the South because the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were basically dead in the water. They're not being enforced.&#10;&#10;African Americans had been denied the right to vote in the late eighteen hundreds. You had Jim Crow laws and desegregation and discrimination and prejudice in all aspects of life. African Americans in the South were sanctioned were victims of sanctioned violence by law and had nowhere to turn, in the government or the courts. There's no way that a southern white jury would convict a white person for, murdering an African American. Now the civil rights movement takes on two wings.&#10;&#10;First off, a movement at law. One wing, the movement at law, trying to deal with the three branches of government. This was centered around from 1910 on, the NAACP, which filed lawsuits to get the courts to declare violations of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment by the Southern states. Also included, effort to get new laws passed by congress to stop the abuses. And then efforts to get whatever whoever happened to be president to actually enforce and espouse these new laws.&#10;&#10;So the movement at law, court cases get new laws passed, get laws enforced, NAACP. The other wing was a grassroots participatory movement characterized by the use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay? Use use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay.&#10;&#10;Some of the background and roots of the civil rights movement. In 1910, the founding of the NAACP by W. E. B. Du Bois used the courts and aim at an inclusionary society, restoring rights, etcetera.&#10;&#10;It was viewed as radical in the early nineteen hundreds, but by 1960 or so, seen as fairly moderate. Second, the movements for black separatism, black power, Booker t coming from Booker t Washington and his economic self help approach. In the nineteen twenties, Marcus Garvey and his, black nationalism ideas. The great migration has is a factor because it makes race a national issue. Before the Great Migration, ninety percent of African Americans lived in the South.&#10;&#10;So it was just kind of an isolated seen as an isolated Southern issue, and that changes. You you also had the FDR administrations in the nineteen thirties, looking after African American issues, etcetera, to an extent with his his black cabinet, etcetera. And then, you know, there were some pickets and boycotts in the nineteen thirties. But the re one of the real catalysts, and we've talked about this before, was World War two. World War two increased aspirations, for African Americans and when, because it provided better education and economic opportunities.&#10;&#10;You had a Philip Randolph's march, threatened march on Washington, which forced, FDR, remember, to issue executive order eighty eight zero two, which banned hiring, discrimination in hiring in defense industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission. You had the double v campaign during World War two. Okay? And the growth in membership of the NAACP during the war from 50,000 to 450,000. And then post World War two, you had Truman who was the first president to openly advocate civil rights.&#10;&#10;Remember in 1948, he desegregated the military. You had the post war growth of African American organizations, both the NAACP and a new one called CORE, Congress on Racial Equality, which focused on, direct action nonviolent protest. And you had the NAACP chipping away at, desec segregation and Jim Crow laws, through the federal courts. But it's in the post World War two years that the civil rights movement turns into a mass movement, and there's a couple reasons for that. First was African American urbanization.&#10;&#10;African Americans moving because of the great migration, moving more and more to cities, find commonalities among themselves, and it ends their rural isolation. They saw together that they had the power to challenge discrimination. And, therefore, the movement in the nineteen fifties is gonna be strongest in southern cities. Secondly, religious faith plays a big role. Faith that everyone is equal before god gave African Americans greater determination to work for equality.&#10;&#10;And the centers of the movement are going to be the African American churches and historically African American colleges in southern cities. They provided places to meet, plan, and pray, and also provided leadership for the movement, for example, like the reverend doctor doctor Martin Luther King Junior. Okay? The focus on constitutional rights was also significant because African Americans felt confident that what they were asking for was already sanctioned by the constitution, through the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and therefore, they were not asking for anything extremely radical. Fourth, media coverage of what was going on was absolutely crucial.&#10;&#10;Television coverage showed what was happening and produced shock and outrage even among northern whites. And it may also made The US look bad in Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. And finally, African independence movements in the nineteen fifties and sixties inspired American African Americans and challenged them to work harder. Okay. Now we get into the major events that are significant for the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The first being the landmark Supreme Court case, Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, oftentimes shortened as into Brown versus Board. This was in 1954. In 1954, the chief justice, Earl Warren, made a ruling, which upheld and sanctioned the argument made by the NAACP lawyer in the case, a guy by the name of Thurgood Marshall, who, by the way, is a was a Baltimore native. Thurgood Marshall, is a very famous African American. He first becomes nationally well known for successfully arguing the Brown versus Board case in 1954.&#10;&#10;And then in 1967, president Lyndon Johnson appoints him the first African American to ever sit on the Supreme Court. The ID what the Brown versus Board of Education decision did was it overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine. Okay? So you wanna know that. That comes up a lot.&#10;&#10;It overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine by saying separate facilities are inherently unequal. That was Marshall's argument. Chief justice Earl Warren and the court agreed. Separate facilities were ruled inherently unequal and violations of the fourteenth amendment. Therefore, school segregation was unconstitutional and illegal.&#10;&#10;Now there was a follow-up decision called Brown two in nineteen fifty four five, which was the implementing decision. And the court said there, and this was kind of ambivalent, that the South must desegregate its public schools, quote, with all deliberate speed and good faith. This is gonna lead to Southern intransigence and Southern states dragging their feet on the issue. But the fundamental breakthrough decision is made. Plessy is overturned.&#10;&#10;Separate facilities are inherently unequal. Okay? The impact is a reaction by Southerners. The Southern members of Congress, put together a a document called the Southern Manifesto saying that the Brown decision was an abuse of judicial power and a violation of states' rights. But the decision laid the foundations for the restoration of rights and the fourteenth amendment, and it also raised expectations and injected a lot of energy into the civil rights movement.&#10;&#10;But at first, the Southern states do very little to desegregate, and so there's gonna have to be additional things that happen down the road. Second event in the summer of nineteen fifty five was the lynching of Emmett Till. Emmett Till was a 14 year old African American from Chicago who was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he called out to a white woman who was exiting a store. Her she went home, told her husband, her husband and some of his buddies found out where Emmett Till was staying. He was taken, and he was lynched.&#10;&#10;And it received extensive media coverage with photo spreads, pretty graphic photo spreads in both Life and Jack Jet magazines, and it horrified the nation. Everyone knew who did it, but the clearly guilty white defendants were acquitted by a white Mississippi jury. The impact was outrage and horror, the view among Northerners that the southern judicial system was a joke, and it further injected energy into the civil rights movement for African Americans to stand up against whites. The third major event was the Montgomery bus boycott of nineteen fifty six. 12/01/1955, a woman named Rosa Parks defied the law requiring in Montgomery, Alabama defied the the law requiring African Americans to give up their seats to white passengers and sit in the back of the bus.&#10;&#10;She's arrested and jailed. Rosa Parks' arrest mobilized the black community in Montgomery, Alabama, and African American women in Montgomery organized a boycott of city buses to put economic pressure on the bus company since most of the bus company's customers were African American. And very significantly, a new leader emerges, in this movement, and that is doctor Reverend Martin Luther King Junior, born in Atlanta, PhD in theology from Boston University. And he had just come to he had not been in Montgomery very long. He'd become a pastor in Montgomery in 1954.&#10;&#10;And he certainly didn't become go there expecting to become the iconic leader of the civil rights movement, but that's what happened. He's only 27 years old, and African American leaders in Montgomery recognized his eloquence and his political skill. He was greatly influenced by Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi and their strategies and tactics of nonviolent direct action protest. The boycott took huge sacrifices on the part of African Americans. They had to walk, carpool, etcetera.&#10;&#10;King's House was bombed one one month into the boycott. White leaders in Montgomery formed a White Citizens Council, made up of 10,000 Montgomery whites, and it spurred the formation of white white citizens councils all over the South in the fifties, to oppose integration. They were known as the, Uptown KKK. They were more, you know, slightly more sophisticated and more urban than the KKK. Rosa Parks' test case went to the Supreme Court in 1956, and the court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.&#10;&#10;It's a great victory for the civil rights movement. And it's an ideal link of the bus boycott and Martin Luther King Junior. Alright? And the nonviolent direct action protest becomes the number one tactic of the civil rights movement. And King plays a role no one else can play and plays it with consummate skill.&#10;&#10;The final event that I wanna talk about is, we'll get into this. The the Brown the Brown and Montgomery bus boycott bound decision Montgomery bus boycott powerfully accelerate the civil rights movement. And the movement at law, a victory in the court case in Brown, energized the grassroots side of the movement, which led to, the Montgomery Bus Boycott. So you have this sort of circling, cycling influence between the movement at law and the grassroots movement. Okay.&#10;&#10;Let's go to 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The governor of Arkansas, a guy by the name of Orville Faubus, opposed the desegregation of schools in the capital city of Little Rock. He ordered the National Guard to prevent nine black students from entering all white Central High School in Little Rock. And when these students attempted to enter, a white mob screamed at them. There was a move to lynch them, but that was defused thankfully.&#10;&#10;President Eisenhower was slow to act. He didn't believe in using the federal government to stop segregation. But with Faubus' challenge and defiance of a Supreme Court decision, Eisenhower had no choice. As president, he had to enforce federal law. And he reluctantly ordered federal troops to Little Rock to maintain order while the law was carried out.&#10;&#10;And Eisenhower said, mob rule cannot override the decisions of our courts. The troops escorted the African American kids to class every day, and the situation stayed tense. In fact, Faubus, the following school year, shut down the Little Rock schools entirely, in an effort to stop desegregation. But in 1958, the Supreme Court ruled that evasive schemes to avoid integration were illegal. And in 1959, the Little Rock Schools were peacefully reopened and integrated.&#10;&#10;Now so despite all this, finally, there were some disappointments. The desegregation of schools went about, painfully slowly, due to white intransigence. The civil there was a Civil Rights Act passed in 1957 by congress. It set up a US Commission on Civil Rights to investigate violations, but it had no enforcement powers. Alright?&#10;&#10;A voting rights act in passed in 1960 was an absolute joke, and it was clear that more grassroots action had to happen. And so that just plays into what's gonna go in, to the civil rights movement in the nineteen sixties, which is one of our topics in assignment 8.6. So there you have it, folks. Nineteen fifties society and culture and the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties. Take care.">

    <MESSAGE value="Add files via upload&#10;&#10;&#10;Well, hello again. This is mister Wagner back with the next episode in our ongoing series of AP US History podcasts. This time, we're dealing with assignment 8.4. And 8.4 is has two main topics. First, society and culture during the nineteen fifties and then the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;So let's talk about society and culture in the nineteen fifties. Let's talk about reviews and reviews. Historians have had changing assessments of the nineteen fifties. From the late fifties on, the count was pretty critical. That was a plastic, plastered, wasted decade of middle class oriented satisfaction.&#10;&#10;It was conservative seen as conservative, conformist, cult cautious, that, you know, The US succeeded in satisfying personal pleasures but neglected public purpose. Now over the past thirty years or so, historians' views in the nineteen fifties have changed. They see it now as a period of prosperity and happy times and of changing perspectives, are are sort of the root of this. We've become a much more conservative country in the last thirty five or so years. And the lengthening perspectives by the eighties and nineties, the fifties seemed okay after the sixties and the turmoil of the sixties and seventies.&#10;&#10;The nineteen fifties weren't a monolith. They were multidimensional and complicated. You had McCarthyism. You had Brown versus Board of Education, the Montgomery bus boycott, Sputnik. I don't think this is placid, do you?&#10;&#10;Extraordinary art, science, and literature, and extraordinarily important social and economic developments occurring almost unnoticed. Below the surface of politics and policy, there were big developments of long lasting impact. And often in history, social and economic and demographic population changes go on regardless of what the government does or doesn't do. So let's talk about the nineteen fifties economy. The nineteen fifties economy was exceptionally prosperous, and The US economy experienced extraordinary growth.&#10;&#10;The gross national product, GNP, the sum total of the value of goods and services produced in the economy was a hundred billion dollars in nineteen forty, two hundred billion dollars in 1945, '3 hundred billion in 1950. And by 1960, it was 500,000,000,000. So this is a quintupling of the GNP in twenty years And, increasing one and a half times just in the decade of the nineteen fifties. That is an explosion of economic productivity. Factors why?&#10;&#10;Why did this happen? The factors leading to economic growth. A lot of private investment. There was a huge jump in private investment. Second, there was a lot of consumer spending.&#10;&#10;Still pent up demand from the war and people making better money from post war jobs. Government spending on both defense and social welfare programs, military and domestic spending. And the federal government's percent federal government spending as a percentage of the gross national product, by the nineteen sixties was at 17%. You look at the nineteen twenties, it was 1%. So the amount relative amount that the government's spending is influencing the GNP really significantly fueled growth as well.&#10;&#10;Also, the baby boom, and we're gonna talk about, the baby boom. The baby boom and and all that went with it also fueled spending. Fifth, technology and automation and the first computers. Output per worker went up 50%, but prices stayed down. It was a very low period of inflation.&#10;&#10;So real income and the standard of living went up. Farm technology, increased agricultural production, which meant lower prices. And so the percentage of the their income that a family had to spend on food, went down while their overall income went up, which meant they had a lot more income for other things other than food, to spend on other things other than food. Also, factor in the economy was what we call giantism, the domination of the economy by massive huge corporations. And by 1958, zero point '1 percent of all corporations accounted for 50% of corporate income.&#10;&#10;And consolidation was going on in farming too with smaller family farms being bought out by agricultural agricultural corporations and the prevalence of agribusiness. So affluence. Real wages, that's wages adjusted for inflation, in the nineteen fifties increased 20%. And by the late nineteen fifties, '2 thirds of the population was in middle class ranking. And by the mid fifties, there are more white collar workers than blue collar workers, more administrative and service oriented people than there were factory workers.&#10;&#10;The fifties also saw the explosion of a consumer culture. In in the nineteen fifties, the US made up 5% of the world's population, but have accounted for one third of the world's consumption of goods and services. Also, with more leisure time, people working fewer hours and increased life expectancy, life expectancy on average, increased from around 60 to around 70 in the nineteen fifties. And so people had more time on their hands to buy stuff. And you look at advertising.&#10;&#10;Advertising in the nineteen fifties increased the amount of money spent on advertising increased 400%. People were also buying on credit. Consumer credit went from 8,000,000,000 in 1950 to 50,000,000,000 in 1960. Another area of phenomenal growth and domination, television becomes a huge thing in the nineteen fifties. Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In 1946, there were 17,000 televisions in The United States. Okay? Just eleven years later in 1957, there were 40,000,000 televisions. Okay? The number of cars exploded as well.&#10;&#10;Nineteen forty five, there were 26,000,000 registered automobiles. In 1960, '60 '2 million registered automobiles. There's also a huge amount of home building in the nineteen fifties. Okay? Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In '19 if we went around in 1960 and looked at all the existing homes in The United States in 1960, we would find that between a quarter and a third of them had been built in the nineteen fifties, which is crazy. And by the nineteen fifties, '50 percent of families owned their own homes. So all of this growth is just absolutely off the charts. And it's not that you need to know the specific statistics, but just the pattern. Okay?&#10;&#10;The patterns that that are going on. However, amidst all this prosperity, there still were what I like to call pervasive pockets of poverty. But this poverty seemed more and more invisible. Why? Because it was increasingly, rare and out of the main sort of sort of way that people traveled, because of interstate highways, partially.&#10;&#10;Power pervasive pockets of poverty were mostly in inner city areas and isolated rural areas, and and existed among the elderly with fixed incomes, minorities, non white people, unskilled and uneducated workers, Southerners, both white and black, and households headed by women. So that's where I wanted to go with an initial kinda discussion of the nineteen fifties economy. Huge prosperity, but in the midst of that, pervasive pockets of poverty. Now very, very important in the nineteen fifties are demographic patterns, shifts and patterns in the population. The biggest one is known as the baby boom, and the baby boom generation is considered anybody who was born between the years 1946 and 1964.&#10;&#10;In those years, the birth rate went up thirty three percent. Okay? Now that was temporary, and it went back down starting in the mid sixties. But and it was a reversal of a long term trend. But tons of babies being born in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The US population in the fifties went from a 50,000,000 to a 80,000,000. And a lot of that fueled by natural increase, meaning by not by immigration, but by people having lots of babies. In 1935, there were 33,000,000 kids 14. It was 25% of the population. In 1960, there were 56,000,000 kids 14.&#10;&#10;One third of a much larger population. The effects of this, the cult of domesticity came back. Women seen as the, you know, their role being as creating the ideal household environment for husband and kids because it had to because there were so many kids. It also fueled prosperity because with all these kids, you're gonna have the building of schools and things like that. But the prosperity fueled the baby boom too.&#10;&#10;People were having more kids because they were doing better economically. It also contributed to the unrest of the nineteen sixties because you had this huge age age cohort going into colleges, etcetera, and also the economic squeeze of the seventies and eighties because when that age cohort you know, this large age cohort of people reaching a a point where they're going out and getting jobs and there just wasn't weren't enough jobs for them. So demographic trend number one, the baby boom. Second demographic trend, a move to the Sun Belt States. Population was flowing to states where the weather tended to be nicer and warmer for longer the year.&#10;&#10;People moving from the industrial Northeast industrial quadrant to the Pacific Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the South Atlantic. And this this had already been going on, but it accelerated in the nineteen fifties. The population of the West Coast in the forties and fifties increased a 10%. Think about that. The population of the West Coast more than doubled.&#10;&#10;Why? Well, the warmer climate, but those states tended to also, in those days, have lower taxes and greater economic opportunity. A lot of defense industries had been set up in the Sun Belt States. So what were the effects of the move to the Sunbelt? Well, changes in lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Second, location of businesses. Third, there was a political sort of effect because the Sunbelt States tended to be, in those days, more conservative. And so if the population goes up, they get more representatives in the house, and they get more electoral votes in presidential elections. And so it shifts shifts in the political power to the Sunbelt State areas. And you can see partly an example of this flow of population is the movement of Major League Baseball teams.&#10;&#10;It's in this era that the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn out to Los Angeles. The Giants moved from New York to San Francisco. The Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee and then to Atlanta. And the A's move from Philadelphia to Kansas City and then eventually to Oakland. So baseball moves to the Sun Belt as the population moves to the Sun Belt.&#10;&#10;Demographic change and trend number three, the movement to suburbs. Causes, there was a housing shortage, a desperate housing shortage, and a construction boom. Second, mass produced low cost family houses, prefab houses. They were these housing developments were known as Levittowns. The first one being on Long Island.&#10;&#10;These just kinda like cookie cutter houses on perfectly gridded, you know, street setups, etcetera, that that could be constructed very quickly in large numbers known as Levittowns. So if you see the term Levittown, it refers to the increased suburbanization of The United States in the nineteen fifties. Low mortgage rates, government insured, and tax deductible, so buying a house was more affordable as well. And by the nineteen sixties, the number of suburbanites equaled the number of urbanites. Okay.&#10;&#10;So what what were the effects of this? Well, people moving lots of people moving from the rural United States to both cities and suburbs. Second, the middle class moving out of the cities to the suburbs because they wanted to escape all the problems associated with city life. Third, more African Americans moving into inner cities from the Midwest and the South. 4, the relocation of businesses and industry to the suburbs because that's where people were moving.&#10;&#10;So you have the first shopping malls, and these shopping malls replace downtown urban shopping areas. Suburbanization is a disaster for American cities. By the nineteen sixties, cities are increasingly poor and racially segregated and divided. And the political power of cities, because they're losing population, decreases. And you also have, you know, what we would call suburban sprawl, etcetera, going on as well.&#10;&#10;Okay. Now let's take a look at nineteen fifties popular culture. It's a consumer culture and a culture of conformity. First off, television. Television suddenly became the center of family life.&#10;&#10;It was dominated by the three major networks. You didn't have cable and then you had three channels basically, ABC, CBS, NBC. It was very bland. Mostly what was on there was pretty much identical sitcoms, westerns, quiz shows, and sports. And the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Newton Minow, called it a vast cultural wasteland.&#10;&#10;And there already was a concern about what the impact of excessive TV viewing would have on the kids. But the culture portrayed on TV helped homogenize US culture. We have, you know, had shows like Ozzie and Harriet, I Love Lucy, Father Knows Best. You know, some of those shows you can still watch on some of the classic channels. They still show them.&#10;&#10;Advertising, promoted common material wants and the means to satisfy them. We have the first, again, the first malls and the first credit cards. And you see a change from so called mom and pop stores to franchises. For example, McDonald's, first comes on the scene in the nineteen fifties. Another trend in the nineteen fifties was paperback books.&#10;&#10;US was reading more than ever. Listen to this. By by 1960 in The United States, a million paperback books were sold a day. A million a day. Pop music also revolutionized by mass marketing of, vinyl LPs and 40 fives that were really sync cheap.&#10;&#10;And the the emergent trend in music in the nineteen fifties, of course, was rock and roll. The introduce introduction of rock and roll, which derived from African American music, African American rhythm and blues, blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz. And also threw in a little bit of, influence of white country music as well. And, of course, the biggest star in the nineteen fifties was Elvis. Thank you very much.&#10;&#10;Elvis Presley. Alright. Corporate America was dominated by these huge conglomerates with diversified holdings, and that became the trend. And it caused conformity. Working for a big company, it was seen that perhaps it caused people to lose their individuality.&#10;&#10;You would conform to the corporate team, you know, conservative dress. And the loss of individuality was domin documented in the book by a sociologist William White, called The Organization Man, which was published in 1956. You also had huge labor unions, the AFL and the CIO merged in 1955 to become the AFL CIO. And unions also became more conservative as blue collar workers work their way up toward middle class incomes. And you also had the, you know, the peer pressure of conforming, in the middle class suburbs.&#10;&#10;In terms of religion, organized religion boomed after World War two, maybe fueled by fears from the cold war. New religious tolerance and a lack of interest in religious doctrine became the norm. You also had radio and TV, the first televangelists on TV. A guy by the name of Billy Graham, became the most famous televangelist in in America. And religious member membership in a church became a source of identity and and and also socialization.&#10;&#10;Okay. In terms of women, traditional roles were reaffirmed. The baby boom necessitated, homemaking as a full time job for for millions of women. And you had doctor Benjamin Spock and his book, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946, reinforces the mother's role as caregiver. But there's growing dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;More women are also at the same time, it's kinda weird. There's two trends going on. More women are working in the nineteen fifties. Women are 30% of the workforce by 1960. College educated, middle class, and married women are working more and starting their own careers because they want to, not necessarily just to supplement the family's income.&#10;&#10;And maybe this revival of the cult of domesticity was actually a reaction against social changes that were already taking place. There were plenty of social critics of the conformity of the nineteen fifties. There were social scientists such as the sociologist David Reisman, who wrote a book called The Lonely Crowd in 1958. He criticized the replacement of the interdirected individual with, people focused on outer directed conformity. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith, wrote a book called The Affluent Society also in 1958, which talked about the failure of the wealthy United States to address the need for increased spending on social programs for the common good.&#10;&#10;And these all are gonna influence both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the nineteen sixties where we're gonna see another, you know, with Lyndon Johnson's great society, another spurt of social reform impetus. And finally, also in novels, big theme in novels in the nineteen fifties is the individual struggle against conformity. One of the the most typical novels here is JD Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. And many of you may have read Catcher in the Rye. It's it's a comment on the phoniness of of nineteen fifties culture by a rebellious teenager.&#10;&#10;Okay? You also had Joseph Heller's Catch 22, satire of the stupidity of the military and of war. And then a guy by the name of Ralph Ellison, an African American who wrote a book called The Invisible Man, which talked about the African American condition in the nineteen fifties. Avant garde saw the emergence of the Beat Generation, the Beatniks, rebellious writers and intellectuals in the fifties, led by a guy named Jack Kerouac in his book On the Road from 1957 and the poet Allen Ginsberg in his poem Howl from 1956. They advocated spontaneity, use of drugs, and rebellion against societal standards.&#10;&#10;And they became models for the youth rebellion of the nineteen sixties, which we will be dealing with in later assignments. Okay. That kind of wraps up the first main topic of 8.4, and that's nineteen fifties society and culture. Okay. Now we get into the second part of the podcast, and this is on the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;Let's start with the the goals, nature, and roots of the civil rights movement. What were the major goals? To restore the original and full meanings of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. In other words, if you do that, you end segregation, you end Jim Crow, and you guarantee voting rights. It was fundamentally inclusionary.&#10;&#10;African Americans wanting to be included in within the full exercise of citizenship and voting rights. It was also integrationist, interracial in ideology and makeup. So there was there was both races taking part here rooted largely in the African American experience, but there was a good deal of white support both asked for and received. Initially, it's focused on the South because the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were basically dead in the water. They're not being enforced.&#10;&#10;African Americans had been denied the right to vote in the late eighteen hundreds. You had Jim Crow laws and desegregation and discrimination and prejudice in all aspects of life. African Americans in the South were sanctioned were victims of sanctioned violence by law and had nowhere to turn, in the government or the courts. There's no way that a southern white jury would convict a white person for, murdering an African American. Now the civil rights movement takes on two wings.&#10;&#10;First off, a movement at law. One wing, the movement at law, trying to deal with the three branches of government. This was centered around from 1910 on, the NAACP, which filed lawsuits to get the courts to declare violations of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment by the Southern states. Also included, effort to get new laws passed by congress to stop the abuses. And then efforts to get whatever whoever happened to be president to actually enforce and espouse these new laws.&#10;&#10;So the movement at law, court cases get new laws passed, get laws enforced, NAACP. The other wing was a grassroots participatory movement characterized by the use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay? Use use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay.&#10;&#10;Some of the background and roots of the civil rights movement. In 1910, the founding of the NAACP by W. E. B. Du Bois used the courts and aim at an inclusionary society, restoring rights, etcetera.&#10;&#10;It was viewed as radical in the early nineteen hundreds, but by 1960 or so, seen as fairly moderate. Second, the movements for black separatism, black power, Booker t coming from Booker t Washington and his economic self help approach. In the nineteen twenties, Marcus Garvey and his, black nationalism ideas. The great migration has is a factor because it makes race a national issue. Before the Great Migration, ninety percent of African Americans lived in the South.&#10;&#10;So it was just kind of an isolated seen as an isolated Southern issue, and that changes. You you also had the FDR administrations in the nineteen thirties, looking after African American issues, etcetera, to an extent with his his black cabinet, etcetera. And then, you know, there were some pickets and boycotts in the nineteen thirties. But the re one of the real catalysts, and we've talked about this before, was World War two. World War two increased aspirations, for African Americans and when, because it provided better education and economic opportunities.&#10;&#10;You had a Philip Randolph's march, threatened march on Washington, which forced, FDR, remember, to issue executive order eighty eight zero two, which banned hiring, discrimination in hiring in defense industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission. You had the double v campaign during World War two. Okay? And the growth in membership of the NAACP during the war from 50,000 to 450,000. And then post World War two, you had Truman who was the first president to openly advocate civil rights.&#10;&#10;Remember in 1948, he desegregated the military. You had the post war growth of African American organizations, both the NAACP and a new one called CORE, Congress on Racial Equality, which focused on, direct action nonviolent protest. And you had the NAACP chipping away at, desec segregation and Jim Crow laws, through the federal courts. But it's in the post World War two years that the civil rights movement turns into a mass movement, and there's a couple reasons for that. First was African American urbanization.&#10;&#10;African Americans moving because of the great migration, moving more and more to cities, find commonalities among themselves, and it ends their rural isolation. They saw together that they had the power to challenge discrimination. And, therefore, the movement in the nineteen fifties is gonna be strongest in southern cities. Secondly, religious faith plays a big role. Faith that everyone is equal before god gave African Americans greater determination to work for equality.&#10;&#10;And the centers of the movement are going to be the African American churches and historically African American colleges in southern cities. They provided places to meet, plan, and pray, and also provided leadership for the movement, for example, like the reverend doctor doctor Martin Luther King Junior. Okay? The focus on constitutional rights was also significant because African Americans felt confident that what they were asking for was already sanctioned by the constitution, through the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and therefore, they were not asking for anything extremely radical. Fourth, media coverage of what was going on was absolutely crucial.&#10;&#10;Television coverage showed what was happening and produced shock and outrage even among northern whites. And it may also made The US look bad in Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. And finally, African independence movements in the nineteen fifties and sixties inspired American African Americans and challenged them to work harder. Okay. Now we get into the major events that are significant for the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The first being the landmark Supreme Court case, Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, oftentimes shortened as into Brown versus Board. This was in 1954. In 1954, the chief justice, Earl Warren, made a ruling, which upheld and sanctioned the argument made by the NAACP lawyer in the case, a guy by the name of Thurgood Marshall, who, by the way, is a was a Baltimore native. Thurgood Marshall, is a very famous African American. He first becomes nationally well known for successfully arguing the Brown versus Board case in 1954.&#10;&#10;And then in 1967, president Lyndon Johnson appoints him the first African American to ever sit on the Supreme Court. The ID what the Brown versus Board of Education decision did was it overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine. Okay? So you wanna know that. That comes up a lot.&#10;&#10;It overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine by saying separate facilities are inherently unequal. That was Marshall's argument. Chief justice Earl Warren and the court agreed. Separate facilities were ruled inherently unequal and violations of the fourteenth amendment. Therefore, school segregation was unconstitutional and illegal.&#10;&#10;Now there was a follow-up decision called Brown two in nineteen fifty four five, which was the implementing decision. And the court said there, and this was kind of ambivalent, that the South must desegregate its public schools, quote, with all deliberate speed and good faith. This is gonna lead to Southern intransigence and Southern states dragging their feet on the issue. But the fundamental breakthrough decision is made. Plessy is overturned.&#10;&#10;Separate facilities are inherently unequal. Okay? The impact is a reaction by Southerners. The Southern members of Congress, put together a a document called the Southern Manifesto saying that the Brown decision was an abuse of judicial power and a violation of states' rights. But the decision laid the foundations for the restoration of rights and the fourteenth amendment, and it also raised expectations and injected a lot of energy into the civil rights movement.&#10;&#10;But at first, the Southern states do very little to desegregate, and so there's gonna have to be additional things that happen down the road. Second event in the summer of nineteen fifty five was the lynching of Emmett Till. Emmett Till was a 14 year old African American from Chicago who was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he called out to a white woman who was exiting a store. Her she went home, told her husband, her husband and some of his buddies found out where Emmett Till was staying. He was taken, and he was lynched.&#10;&#10;And it received extensive media coverage with photo spreads, pretty graphic photo spreads in both Life and Jack Jet magazines, and it horrified the nation. Everyone knew who did it, but the clearly guilty white defendants were acquitted by a white Mississippi jury. The impact was outrage and horror, the view among Northerners that the southern judicial system was a joke, and it further injected energy into the civil rights movement for African Americans to stand up against whites. The third major event was the Montgomery bus boycott of nineteen fifty six. 12/01/1955, a woman named Rosa Parks defied the law requiring in Montgomery, Alabama defied the the law requiring African Americans to give up their seats to white passengers and sit in the back of the bus.&#10;&#10;She's arrested and jailed. Rosa Parks' arrest mobilized the black community in Montgomery, Alabama, and African American women in Montgomery organized a boycott of city buses to put economic pressure on the bus company since most of the bus company's customers were African American. And very significantly, a new leader emerges, in this movement, and that is doctor Reverend Martin Luther King Junior, born in Atlanta, PhD in theology from Boston University. And he had just come to he had not been in Montgomery very long. He'd become a pastor in Montgomery in 1954.&#10;&#10;And he certainly didn't become go there expecting to become the iconic leader of the civil rights movement, but that's what happened. He's only 27 years old, and African American leaders in Montgomery recognized his eloquence and his political skill. He was greatly influenced by Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi and their strategies and tactics of nonviolent direct action protest. The boycott took huge sacrifices on the part of African Americans. They had to walk, carpool, etcetera.&#10;&#10;King's House was bombed one one month into the boycott. White leaders in Montgomery formed a White Citizens Council, made up of 10,000 Montgomery whites, and it spurred the formation of white white citizens councils all over the South in the fifties, to oppose integration. They were known as the, Uptown KKK. They were more, you know, slightly more sophisticated and more urban than the KKK. Rosa Parks' test case went to the Supreme Court in 1956, and the court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.&#10;&#10;It's a great victory for the civil rights movement. And it's an ideal link of the bus boycott and Martin Luther King Junior. Alright? And the nonviolent direct action protest becomes the number one tactic of the civil rights movement. And King plays a role no one else can play and plays it with consummate skill.&#10;&#10;The final event that I wanna talk about is, we'll get into this. The the Brown the Brown and Montgomery bus boycott bound decision Montgomery bus boycott powerfully accelerate the civil rights movement. And the movement at law, a victory in the court case in Brown, energized the grassroots side of the movement, which led to, the Montgomery Bus Boycott. So you have this sort of circling, cycling influence between the movement at law and the grassroots movement. Okay.&#10;&#10;Let's go to 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The governor of Arkansas, a guy by the name of Orville Faubus, opposed the desegregation of schools in the capital city of Little Rock. He ordered the National Guard to prevent nine black students from entering all white Central High School in Little Rock. And when these students attempted to enter, a white mob screamed at them. There was a move to lynch them, but that was defused thankfully.&#10;&#10;President Eisenhower was slow to act. He didn't believe in using the federal government to stop segregation. But with Faubus' challenge and defiance of a Supreme Court decision, Eisenhower had no choice. As president, he had to enforce federal law. And he reluctantly ordered federal troops to Little Rock to maintain order while the law was carried out.&#10;&#10;And Eisenhower said, mob rule cannot override the decisions of our courts. The troops escorted the African American kids to class every day, and the situation stayed tense. In fact, Faubus, the following school year, shut down the Little Rock schools entirely, in an effort to stop desegregation. But in 1958, the Supreme Court ruled that evasive schemes to avoid integration were illegal. And in 1959, the Little Rock Schools were peacefully reopened and integrated.&#10;&#10;Now so despite all this, finally, there were some disappointments. The desegregation of schools went about, painfully slowly, due to white intransigence. The civil there was a Civil Rights Act passed in 1957 by congress. It set up a US Commission on Civil Rights to investigate violations, but it had no enforcement powers. Alright?&#10;&#10;A voting rights act in passed in 1960 was an absolute joke, and it was clear that more grassroots action had to happen. And so that just plays into what's gonna go in, to the civil rights movement in the nineteen sixties, which is one of our topics in assignment 8.6. So there you have it, folks. Nineteen fifties society and culture and the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties. Take care." />
    <option name="LAST_COMMIT_MESSAGE" value="Add files via upload&#10;&#10;&#10;Well, hello again. This is mister Wagner back with the next episode in our ongoing series of AP US History podcasts. This time, we're dealing with assignment 8.4. And 8.4 is has two main topics. First, society and culture during the nineteen fifties and then the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;So let's talk about society and culture in the nineteen fifties. Let's talk about reviews and reviews. Historians have had changing assessments of the nineteen fifties. From the late fifties on, the count was pretty critical. That was a plastic, plastered, wasted decade of middle class oriented satisfaction.&#10;&#10;It was conservative seen as conservative, conformist, cult cautious, that, you know, The US succeeded in satisfying personal pleasures but neglected public purpose. Now over the past thirty years or so, historians' views in the nineteen fifties have changed. They see it now as a period of prosperity and happy times and of changing perspectives, are are sort of the root of this. We've become a much more conservative country in the last thirty five or so years. And the lengthening perspectives by the eighties and nineties, the fifties seemed okay after the sixties and the turmoil of the sixties and seventies.&#10;&#10;The nineteen fifties weren't a monolith. They were multidimensional and complicated. You had McCarthyism. You had Brown versus Board of Education, the Montgomery bus boycott, Sputnik. I don't think this is placid, do you?&#10;&#10;Extraordinary art, science, and literature, and extraordinarily important social and economic developments occurring almost unnoticed. Below the surface of politics and policy, there were big developments of long lasting impact. And often in history, social and economic and demographic population changes go on regardless of what the government does or doesn't do. So let's talk about the nineteen fifties economy. The nineteen fifties economy was exceptionally prosperous, and The US economy experienced extraordinary growth.&#10;&#10;The gross national product, GNP, the sum total of the value of goods and services produced in the economy was a hundred billion dollars in nineteen forty, two hundred billion dollars in 1945, '3 hundred billion in 1950. And by 1960, it was 500,000,000,000. So this is a quintupling of the GNP in twenty years And, increasing one and a half times just in the decade of the nineteen fifties. That is an explosion of economic productivity. Factors why?&#10;&#10;Why did this happen? The factors leading to economic growth. A lot of private investment. There was a huge jump in private investment. Second, there was a lot of consumer spending.&#10;&#10;Still pent up demand from the war and people making better money from post war jobs. Government spending on both defense and social welfare programs, military and domestic spending. And the federal government's percent federal government spending as a percentage of the gross national product, by the nineteen sixties was at 17%. You look at the nineteen twenties, it was 1%. So the amount relative amount that the government's spending is influencing the GNP really significantly fueled growth as well.&#10;&#10;Also, the baby boom, and we're gonna talk about, the baby boom. The baby boom and and all that went with it also fueled spending. Fifth, technology and automation and the first computers. Output per worker went up 50%, but prices stayed down. It was a very low period of inflation.&#10;&#10;So real income and the standard of living went up. Farm technology, increased agricultural production, which meant lower prices. And so the percentage of the their income that a family had to spend on food, went down while their overall income went up, which meant they had a lot more income for other things other than food, to spend on other things other than food. Also, factor in the economy was what we call giantism, the domination of the economy by massive huge corporations. And by 1958, zero point '1 percent of all corporations accounted for 50% of corporate income.&#10;&#10;And consolidation was going on in farming too with smaller family farms being bought out by agricultural agricultural corporations and the prevalence of agribusiness. So affluence. Real wages, that's wages adjusted for inflation, in the nineteen fifties increased 20%. And by the late nineteen fifties, '2 thirds of the population was in middle class ranking. And by the mid fifties, there are more white collar workers than blue collar workers, more administrative and service oriented people than there were factory workers.&#10;&#10;The fifties also saw the explosion of a consumer culture. In in the nineteen fifties, the US made up 5% of the world's population, but have accounted for one third of the world's consumption of goods and services. Also, with more leisure time, people working fewer hours and increased life expectancy, life expectancy on average, increased from around 60 to around 70 in the nineteen fifties. And so people had more time on their hands to buy stuff. And you look at advertising.&#10;&#10;Advertising in the nineteen fifties increased the amount of money spent on advertising increased 400%. People were also buying on credit. Consumer credit went from 8,000,000,000 in 1950 to 50,000,000,000 in 1960. Another area of phenomenal growth and domination, television becomes a huge thing in the nineteen fifties. Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In 1946, there were 17,000 televisions in The United States. Okay? Just eleven years later in 1957, there were 40,000,000 televisions. Okay? The number of cars exploded as well.&#10;&#10;Nineteen forty five, there were 26,000,000 registered automobiles. In 1960, '60 '2 million registered automobiles. There's also a huge amount of home building in the nineteen fifties. Okay? Listen to this.&#10;&#10;In '19 if we went around in 1960 and looked at all the existing homes in The United States in 1960, we would find that between a quarter and a third of them had been built in the nineteen fifties, which is crazy. And by the nineteen fifties, '50 percent of families owned their own homes. So all of this growth is just absolutely off the charts. And it's not that you need to know the specific statistics, but just the pattern. Okay?&#10;&#10;The patterns that that are going on. However, amidst all this prosperity, there still were what I like to call pervasive pockets of poverty. But this poverty seemed more and more invisible. Why? Because it was increasingly, rare and out of the main sort of sort of way that people traveled, because of interstate highways, partially.&#10;&#10;Power pervasive pockets of poverty were mostly in inner city areas and isolated rural areas, and and existed among the elderly with fixed incomes, minorities, non white people, unskilled and uneducated workers, Southerners, both white and black, and households headed by women. So that's where I wanted to go with an initial kinda discussion of the nineteen fifties economy. Huge prosperity, but in the midst of that, pervasive pockets of poverty. Now very, very important in the nineteen fifties are demographic patterns, shifts and patterns in the population. The biggest one is known as the baby boom, and the baby boom generation is considered anybody who was born between the years 1946 and 1964.&#10;&#10;In those years, the birth rate went up thirty three percent. Okay? Now that was temporary, and it went back down starting in the mid sixties. But and it was a reversal of a long term trend. But tons of babies being born in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The US population in the fifties went from a 50,000,000 to a 80,000,000. And a lot of that fueled by natural increase, meaning by not by immigration, but by people having lots of babies. In 1935, there were 33,000,000 kids 14. It was 25% of the population. In 1960, there were 56,000,000 kids 14.&#10;&#10;One third of a much larger population. The effects of this, the cult of domesticity came back. Women seen as the, you know, their role being as creating the ideal household environment for husband and kids because it had to because there were so many kids. It also fueled prosperity because with all these kids, you're gonna have the building of schools and things like that. But the prosperity fueled the baby boom too.&#10;&#10;People were having more kids because they were doing better economically. It also contributed to the unrest of the nineteen sixties because you had this huge age age cohort going into colleges, etcetera, and also the economic squeeze of the seventies and eighties because when that age cohort you know, this large age cohort of people reaching a a point where they're going out and getting jobs and there just wasn't weren't enough jobs for them. So demographic trend number one, the baby boom. Second demographic trend, a move to the Sun Belt States. Population was flowing to states where the weather tended to be nicer and warmer for longer the year.&#10;&#10;People moving from the industrial Northeast industrial quadrant to the Pacific Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the South Atlantic. And this this had already been going on, but it accelerated in the nineteen fifties. The population of the West Coast in the forties and fifties increased a 10%. Think about that. The population of the West Coast more than doubled.&#10;&#10;Why? Well, the warmer climate, but those states tended to also, in those days, have lower taxes and greater economic opportunity. A lot of defense industries had been set up in the Sun Belt States. So what were the effects of the move to the Sunbelt? Well, changes in lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Second, location of businesses. Third, there was a political sort of effect because the Sunbelt States tended to be, in those days, more conservative. And so if the population goes up, they get more representatives in the house, and they get more electoral votes in presidential elections. And so it shifts shifts in the political power to the Sunbelt State areas. And you can see partly an example of this flow of population is the movement of Major League Baseball teams.&#10;&#10;It's in this era that the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn out to Los Angeles. The Giants moved from New York to San Francisco. The Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee and then to Atlanta. And the A's move from Philadelphia to Kansas City and then eventually to Oakland. So baseball moves to the Sun Belt as the population moves to the Sun Belt.&#10;&#10;Demographic change and trend number three, the movement to suburbs. Causes, there was a housing shortage, a desperate housing shortage, and a construction boom. Second, mass produced low cost family houses, prefab houses. They were these housing developments were known as Levittowns. The first one being on Long Island.&#10;&#10;These just kinda like cookie cutter houses on perfectly gridded, you know, street setups, etcetera, that that could be constructed very quickly in large numbers known as Levittowns. So if you see the term Levittown, it refers to the increased suburbanization of The United States in the nineteen fifties. Low mortgage rates, government insured, and tax deductible, so buying a house was more affordable as well. And by the nineteen sixties, the number of suburbanites equaled the number of urbanites. Okay.&#10;&#10;So what what were the effects of this? Well, people moving lots of people moving from the rural United States to both cities and suburbs. Second, the middle class moving out of the cities to the suburbs because they wanted to escape all the problems associated with city life. Third, more African Americans moving into inner cities from the Midwest and the South. 4, the relocation of businesses and industry to the suburbs because that's where people were moving.&#10;&#10;So you have the first shopping malls, and these shopping malls replace downtown urban shopping areas. Suburbanization is a disaster for American cities. By the nineteen sixties, cities are increasingly poor and racially segregated and divided. And the political power of cities, because they're losing population, decreases. And you also have, you know, what we would call suburban sprawl, etcetera, going on as well.&#10;&#10;Okay. Now let's take a look at nineteen fifties popular culture. It's a consumer culture and a culture of conformity. First off, television. Television suddenly became the center of family life.&#10;&#10;It was dominated by the three major networks. You didn't have cable and then you had three channels basically, ABC, CBS, NBC. It was very bland. Mostly what was on there was pretty much identical sitcoms, westerns, quiz shows, and sports. And the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Newton Minow, called it a vast cultural wasteland.&#10;&#10;And there already was a concern about what the impact of excessive TV viewing would have on the kids. But the culture portrayed on TV helped homogenize US culture. We have, you know, had shows like Ozzie and Harriet, I Love Lucy, Father Knows Best. You know, some of those shows you can still watch on some of the classic channels. They still show them.&#10;&#10;Advertising, promoted common material wants and the means to satisfy them. We have the first, again, the first malls and the first credit cards. And you see a change from so called mom and pop stores to franchises. For example, McDonald's, first comes on the scene in the nineteen fifties. Another trend in the nineteen fifties was paperback books.&#10;&#10;US was reading more than ever. Listen to this. By by 1960 in The United States, a million paperback books were sold a day. A million a day. Pop music also revolutionized by mass marketing of, vinyl LPs and 40 fives that were really sync cheap.&#10;&#10;And the the emergent trend in music in the nineteen fifties, of course, was rock and roll. The introduce introduction of rock and roll, which derived from African American music, African American rhythm and blues, blues, rhythm and blues, and jazz. And also threw in a little bit of, influence of white country music as well. And, of course, the biggest star in the nineteen fifties was Elvis. Thank you very much.&#10;&#10;Elvis Presley. Alright. Corporate America was dominated by these huge conglomerates with diversified holdings, and that became the trend. And it caused conformity. Working for a big company, it was seen that perhaps it caused people to lose their individuality.&#10;&#10;You would conform to the corporate team, you know, conservative dress. And the loss of individuality was domin documented in the book by a sociologist William White, called The Organization Man, which was published in 1956. You also had huge labor unions, the AFL and the CIO merged in 1955 to become the AFL CIO. And unions also became more conservative as blue collar workers work their way up toward middle class incomes. And you also had the, you know, the peer pressure of conforming, in the middle class suburbs.&#10;&#10;In terms of religion, organized religion boomed after World War two, maybe fueled by fears from the cold war. New religious tolerance and a lack of interest in religious doctrine became the norm. You also had radio and TV, the first televangelists on TV. A guy by the name of Billy Graham, became the most famous televangelist in in America. And religious member membership in a church became a source of identity and and and also socialization.&#10;&#10;Okay. In terms of women, traditional roles were reaffirmed. The baby boom necessitated, homemaking as a full time job for for millions of women. And you had doctor Benjamin Spock and his book, Baby and Child Care, published in 1946, reinforces the mother's role as caregiver. But there's growing dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;More women are also at the same time, it's kinda weird. There's two trends going on. More women are working in the nineteen fifties. Women are 30% of the workforce by 1960. College educated, middle class, and married women are working more and starting their own careers because they want to, not necessarily just to supplement the family's income.&#10;&#10;And maybe this revival of the cult of domesticity was actually a reaction against social changes that were already taking place. There were plenty of social critics of the conformity of the nineteen fifties. There were social scientists such as the sociologist David Reisman, who wrote a book called The Lonely Crowd in 1958. He criticized the replacement of the interdirected individual with, people focused on outer directed conformity. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith, wrote a book called The Affluent Society also in 1958, which talked about the failure of the wealthy United States to address the need for increased spending on social programs for the common good.&#10;&#10;And these all are gonna influence both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the nineteen sixties where we're gonna see another, you know, with Lyndon Johnson's great society, another spurt of social reform impetus. And finally, also in novels, big theme in novels in the nineteen fifties is the individual struggle against conformity. One of the the most typical novels here is JD Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. And many of you may have read Catcher in the Rye. It's it's a comment on the phoniness of of nineteen fifties culture by a rebellious teenager.&#10;&#10;Okay? You also had Joseph Heller's Catch 22, satire of the stupidity of the military and of war. And then a guy by the name of Ralph Ellison, an African American who wrote a book called The Invisible Man, which talked about the African American condition in the nineteen fifties. Avant garde saw the emergence of the Beat Generation, the Beatniks, rebellious writers and intellectuals in the fifties, led by a guy named Jack Kerouac in his book On the Road from 1957 and the poet Allen Ginsberg in his poem Howl from 1956. They advocated spontaneity, use of drugs, and rebellion against societal standards.&#10;&#10;And they became models for the youth rebellion of the nineteen sixties, which we will be dealing with in later assignments. Okay. That kind of wraps up the first main topic of 8.4, and that's nineteen fifties society and culture. Okay. Now we get into the second part of the podcast, and this is on the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;Let's start with the the goals, nature, and roots of the civil rights movement. What were the major goals? To restore the original and full meanings of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. In other words, if you do that, you end segregation, you end Jim Crow, and you guarantee voting rights. It was fundamentally inclusionary.&#10;&#10;African Americans wanting to be included in within the full exercise of citizenship and voting rights. It was also integrationist, interracial in ideology and makeup. So there was there was both races taking part here rooted largely in the African American experience, but there was a good deal of white support both asked for and received. Initially, it's focused on the South because the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were basically dead in the water. They're not being enforced.&#10;&#10;African Americans had been denied the right to vote in the late eighteen hundreds. You had Jim Crow laws and desegregation and discrimination and prejudice in all aspects of life. African Americans in the South were sanctioned were victims of sanctioned violence by law and had nowhere to turn, in the government or the courts. There's no way that a southern white jury would convict a white person for, murdering an African American. Now the civil rights movement takes on two wings.&#10;&#10;First off, a movement at law. One wing, the movement at law, trying to deal with the three branches of government. This was centered around from 1910 on, the NAACP, which filed lawsuits to get the courts to declare violations of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment by the Southern states. Also included, effort to get new laws passed by congress to stop the abuses. And then efforts to get whatever whoever happened to be president to actually enforce and espouse these new laws.&#10;&#10;So the movement at law, court cases get new laws passed, get laws enforced, NAACP. The other wing was a grassroots participatory movement characterized by the use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay? Use use of direct action, nonviolent protest. Okay.&#10;&#10;Some of the background and roots of the civil rights movement. In 1910, the founding of the NAACP by W. E. B. Du Bois used the courts and aim at an inclusionary society, restoring rights, etcetera.&#10;&#10;It was viewed as radical in the early nineteen hundreds, but by 1960 or so, seen as fairly moderate. Second, the movements for black separatism, black power, Booker t coming from Booker t Washington and his economic self help approach. In the nineteen twenties, Marcus Garvey and his, black nationalism ideas. The great migration has is a factor because it makes race a national issue. Before the Great Migration, ninety percent of African Americans lived in the South.&#10;&#10;So it was just kind of an isolated seen as an isolated Southern issue, and that changes. You you also had the FDR administrations in the nineteen thirties, looking after African American issues, etcetera, to an extent with his his black cabinet, etcetera. And then, you know, there were some pickets and boycotts in the nineteen thirties. But the re one of the real catalysts, and we've talked about this before, was World War two. World War two increased aspirations, for African Americans and when, because it provided better education and economic opportunities.&#10;&#10;You had a Philip Randolph's march, threatened march on Washington, which forced, FDR, remember, to issue executive order eighty eight zero two, which banned hiring, discrimination in hiring in defense industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission. You had the double v campaign during World War two. Okay? And the growth in membership of the NAACP during the war from 50,000 to 450,000. And then post World War two, you had Truman who was the first president to openly advocate civil rights.&#10;&#10;Remember in 1948, he desegregated the military. You had the post war growth of African American organizations, both the NAACP and a new one called CORE, Congress on Racial Equality, which focused on, direct action nonviolent protest. And you had the NAACP chipping away at, desec segregation and Jim Crow laws, through the federal courts. But it's in the post World War two years that the civil rights movement turns into a mass movement, and there's a couple reasons for that. First was African American urbanization.&#10;&#10;African Americans moving because of the great migration, moving more and more to cities, find commonalities among themselves, and it ends their rural isolation. They saw together that they had the power to challenge discrimination. And, therefore, the movement in the nineteen fifties is gonna be strongest in southern cities. Secondly, religious faith plays a big role. Faith that everyone is equal before god gave African Americans greater determination to work for equality.&#10;&#10;And the centers of the movement are going to be the African American churches and historically African American colleges in southern cities. They provided places to meet, plan, and pray, and also provided leadership for the movement, for example, like the reverend doctor doctor Martin Luther King Junior. Okay? The focus on constitutional rights was also significant because African Americans felt confident that what they were asking for was already sanctioned by the constitution, through the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and therefore, they were not asking for anything extremely radical. Fourth, media coverage of what was going on was absolutely crucial.&#10;&#10;Television coverage showed what was happening and produced shock and outrage even among northern whites. And it may also made The US look bad in Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. And finally, African independence movements in the nineteen fifties and sixties inspired American African Americans and challenged them to work harder. Okay. Now we get into the major events that are significant for the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties.&#10;&#10;The first being the landmark Supreme Court case, Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, oftentimes shortened as into Brown versus Board. This was in 1954. In 1954, the chief justice, Earl Warren, made a ruling, which upheld and sanctioned the argument made by the NAACP lawyer in the case, a guy by the name of Thurgood Marshall, who, by the way, is a was a Baltimore native. Thurgood Marshall, is a very famous African American. He first becomes nationally well known for successfully arguing the Brown versus Board case in 1954.&#10;&#10;And then in 1967, president Lyndon Johnson appoints him the first African American to ever sit on the Supreme Court. The ID what the Brown versus Board of Education decision did was it overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine. Okay? So you wanna know that. That comes up a lot.&#10;&#10;It overturned Plessy versus Ferguson and the separate but equal doctrine by saying separate facilities are inherently unequal. That was Marshall's argument. Chief justice Earl Warren and the court agreed. Separate facilities were ruled inherently unequal and violations of the fourteenth amendment. Therefore, school segregation was unconstitutional and illegal.&#10;&#10;Now there was a follow-up decision called Brown two in nineteen fifty four five, which was the implementing decision. And the court said there, and this was kind of ambivalent, that the South must desegregate its public schools, quote, with all deliberate speed and good faith. This is gonna lead to Southern intransigence and Southern states dragging their feet on the issue. But the fundamental breakthrough decision is made. Plessy is overturned.&#10;&#10;Separate facilities are inherently unequal. Okay? The impact is a reaction by Southerners. The Southern members of Congress, put together a a document called the Southern Manifesto saying that the Brown decision was an abuse of judicial power and a violation of states' rights. But the decision laid the foundations for the restoration of rights and the fourteenth amendment, and it also raised expectations and injected a lot of energy into the civil rights movement.&#10;&#10;But at first, the Southern states do very little to desegregate, and so there's gonna have to be additional things that happen down the road. Second event in the summer of nineteen fifty five was the lynching of Emmett Till. Emmett Till was a 14 year old African American from Chicago who was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he called out to a white woman who was exiting a store. Her she went home, told her husband, her husband and some of his buddies found out where Emmett Till was staying. He was taken, and he was lynched.&#10;&#10;And it received extensive media coverage with photo spreads, pretty graphic photo spreads in both Life and Jack Jet magazines, and it horrified the nation. Everyone knew who did it, but the clearly guilty white defendants were acquitted by a white Mississippi jury. The impact was outrage and horror, the view among Northerners that the southern judicial system was a joke, and it further injected energy into the civil rights movement for African Americans to stand up against whites. The third major event was the Montgomery bus boycott of nineteen fifty six. 12/01/1955, a woman named Rosa Parks defied the law requiring in Montgomery, Alabama defied the the law requiring African Americans to give up their seats to white passengers and sit in the back of the bus.&#10;&#10;She's arrested and jailed. Rosa Parks' arrest mobilized the black community in Montgomery, Alabama, and African American women in Montgomery organized a boycott of city buses to put economic pressure on the bus company since most of the bus company's customers were African American. And very significantly, a new leader emerges, in this movement, and that is doctor Reverend Martin Luther King Junior, born in Atlanta, PhD in theology from Boston University. And he had just come to he had not been in Montgomery very long. He'd become a pastor in Montgomery in 1954.&#10;&#10;And he certainly didn't become go there expecting to become the iconic leader of the civil rights movement, but that's what happened. He's only 27 years old, and African American leaders in Montgomery recognized his eloquence and his political skill. He was greatly influenced by Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi and their strategies and tactics of nonviolent direct action protest. The boycott took huge sacrifices on the part of African Americans. They had to walk, carpool, etcetera.&#10;&#10;King's House was bombed one one month into the boycott. White leaders in Montgomery formed a White Citizens Council, made up of 10,000 Montgomery whites, and it spurred the formation of white white citizens councils all over the South in the fifties, to oppose integration. They were known as the, Uptown KKK. They were more, you know, slightly more sophisticated and more urban than the KKK. Rosa Parks' test case went to the Supreme Court in 1956, and the court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.&#10;&#10;It's a great victory for the civil rights movement. And it's an ideal link of the bus boycott and Martin Luther King Junior. Alright? And the nonviolent direct action protest becomes the number one tactic of the civil rights movement. And King plays a role no one else can play and plays it with consummate skill.&#10;&#10;The final event that I wanna talk about is, we'll get into this. The the Brown the Brown and Montgomery bus boycott bound decision Montgomery bus boycott powerfully accelerate the civil rights movement. And the movement at law, a victory in the court case in Brown, energized the grassroots side of the movement, which led to, the Montgomery Bus Boycott. So you have this sort of circling, cycling influence between the movement at law and the grassroots movement. Okay.&#10;&#10;Let's go to 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The governor of Arkansas, a guy by the name of Orville Faubus, opposed the desegregation of schools in the capital city of Little Rock. He ordered the National Guard to prevent nine black students from entering all white Central High School in Little Rock. And when these students attempted to enter, a white mob screamed at them. There was a move to lynch them, but that was defused thankfully.&#10;&#10;President Eisenhower was slow to act. He didn't believe in using the federal government to stop segregation. But with Faubus' challenge and defiance of a Supreme Court decision, Eisenhower had no choice. As president, he had to enforce federal law. And he reluctantly ordered federal troops to Little Rock to maintain order while the law was carried out.&#10;&#10;And Eisenhower said, mob rule cannot override the decisions of our courts. The troops escorted the African American kids to class every day, and the situation stayed tense. In fact, Faubus, the following school year, shut down the Little Rock schools entirely, in an effort to stop desegregation. But in 1958, the Supreme Court ruled that evasive schemes to avoid integration were illegal. And in 1959, the Little Rock Schools were peacefully reopened and integrated.&#10;&#10;Now so despite all this, finally, there were some disappointments. The desegregation of schools went about, painfully slowly, due to white intransigence. The civil there was a Civil Rights Act passed in 1957 by congress. It set up a US Commission on Civil Rights to investigate violations, but it had no enforcement powers. Alright?&#10;&#10;A voting rights act in passed in 1960 was an absolute joke, and it was clear that more grassroots action had to happen. And so that just plays into what's gonna go in, to the civil rights movement in the nineteen sixties, which is one of our topics in assignment 8.6. So there you have it, folks. Nineteen fifties society and culture and the civil rights movement in the nineteen fifties. Take care." />
